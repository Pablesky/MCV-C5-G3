Compute losses graphs and compare them

Compute accuracy graphs and compare them
with yours from Keras


Results and graphics
• When we ask for the accuracy results and graphics, we expect
analysis.
• Do both training and validation loss have the same behavior?
• If you achieve better results with one framework or the other, are the
loss functions coherent with this?
• Seems to be overfitting?
• Is the accuracy the same for all the classes in the dataset?
• Graphics are tools that helps to understand what is happening in your
network / training experiment.


Project presentation
• We won’t consider any experiment you have done and is not
included into the presentation.
• Differently of common presentations, we will check this one
offline, so a little bit of text describing diagrams, plots, figures,
tables and results is expected.
